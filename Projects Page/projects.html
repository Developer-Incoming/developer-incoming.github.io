                            The Drinks Page Project is a project that I wanted to do because at that time of making it
                            I enjoyed the hobby of mixology a lot, and with the knowledge of programming in hand
                            I went to the road of coping the best database, <a
                                href="http://kuletos.com.au/cocktails/-Cocktails">Kuletos' Cocktails</a>,
                            (also I think it's ASP, I did not notice this until it was late), and the reason that I did
                            that because their website was so slow, about 8 seconds in average to open 1 page, it was a
                            lot
                            of time wasted, at least for me.
                            <br>
                            Anyway, It was such a fun time making the code and using multiple languages and learning a
                            lot
                            of JavaScript in the process, and I really appreciate
                            the hard work of the <a href="http://kuletos.com.au">Kuletos</a> for providing the internet
                            with
                            such a good resource.

                    and keep in mind that I won't be publishing any projects that doesn't qualify to be
                    published nor the ones that can't be published as many of them already are.
